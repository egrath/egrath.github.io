<h1>Nothing to see here &hellip;</h1>

<p>&hellip; but feel free to take a look around. This is my personal webspace which acts as a space for various things I want to publish to a broader audience.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m by far not a designer. I like a simple approach for creating this webpage, something that once set up gets out of my way. This is why i chose the following tools and techniques:</p>

<ul>
<li>the content itself is stored as plain markup files with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">John Gruber&rsquo;s</a> syntax</li>
<li>this content is transformed into html with <a href="https://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/">Discount</a></li>
<li>during the transformation, CSS is merged in, which is responsible for the appearance</li>
</ul>


<p>With this approach, whenever I want to create some new page, it boils down to writing something in markup, and rebuild everything (with make)</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in this, you can also take a look into the <a href="https://github.com/egrath/egrath.github.io">github</a> repository for these pages.</p>

<h2>What to find here?</h2>

<p>All content can be found <a href="/pages/pages.html">here</a>. As some of my articles may refer to external files, they are stored on my Nextcloud, which can be found <a href="https://garm.twilightparadox.com/nextcloud/s/wmoCZYD2ZJ5MQM8">here</a>. The access password is changed from time to time, but right now it&rsquo;s <code>jsk2-Sji23-23$djks</code>.</p>

<h2>A cat</h2>

<p>No page is complete without the picture of a cat.</p>
