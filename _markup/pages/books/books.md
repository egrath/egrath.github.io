# List of recommended books
This is a list of books for various topics that I've read, have started to read or intend to do so in the future.

## Computer Architecture & Organization
### Introductory level
1. Computer Architecture - From the Stone Age to Quantum Computing (Fox, 2024)
2. Digital Computer Electronics (Malvino-Brown, 1993)
3. The Elements of Computing Systems (Nisan-Schocken, 2021)

### Intermediate level
4. Computer System Architecture (Mano, 1993)
5. Introduction to Computing Systems (Patt-Patel, 2020)

### Advanced level
6. Digital Design and Computer Architecture (Harris-Harris, 2015)
7. Digital Design Principles and Practices (Wakerly, 2018)

##### Notes to the above list

[1] In my opinion, (3) only makes sense in conjunction with the video course available at coursera ([Part1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer), [Part2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)), as it's really intended to be used alongside them.

[2] For (6), it's intended as either the reading for a undergraduate course or as a self-studying guide. For the former, there are two EdX courses available that you can take ([Part1](https://www.edx.org/learn/design/harvey-mudd-college-digital-design), [Part2](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-architecture/harvey-mudd-college-computer-architecture)). Another course from ETH Zurich which makes use of this book is also available, but it's just the course and you don't get any certificate if you're into that ([Link](https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2018/doku.php?id=schedule))
