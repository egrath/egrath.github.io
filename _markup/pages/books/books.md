# List of recommended books
This is a list of books for various topics that I've read, have started to read or intend to do so in the future.

## Computer Architecture & Organization
### Introductory level
1. Computer Architecture - From the Stone Age to Quantum Computing (Fox, 2024)
2. Digital Computer Electronics (Malvino-Brown, 1993)
3. The Elements of Computing Systems^(1) (Nisan-Schocken, 2021)

### Intermediate level^(2)
4. Computer System Architecture (Mano, 2007)
5. Digital Logic and Computer Design (Mano, 2016)
6. Computer Design and Architecture (Shiva, 2000)

### Advanced level
7. Digital Design and Computer Architecture^(3) (Harris-Harris, 2015)
8. Digital Design Principles and Practices (Wakerly, 2018)
9. Advanced Computer Architectures (Shiva, 2006)

### Additional
10. Digital Logic Circuit Design and Analysis (Nelson et al., 1995)^(4)

##### Notes to the above list

[1] In my opinion, this one only makes sense in conjunction with the video course available at coursera ([Part1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer), [Part2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)), as it's really intended to be used alongside them.

[2] Intermediate level books can be skipped in my opinion. You can immediately jump from introductory to advanced books, they just dive deeper. Alternatively, you can directly start with the intermediate books, they all cover the basics too, but in a way more concise way.

[3] This book is intended as either the reading for a undergraduate course or as a self-studying guide. For the former, there are two EdX courses available that you can take ([Part1](https://www.edx.org/learn/design/harvey-mudd-college-digital-design), [Part2](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-architecture/harvey-mudd-college-computer-architecture)). Another course from ETH Zurich which makes use of this book is also available, but it's just the course and you don't get any certificate if you're into that ([Link](https://safari.ethz.ch/digitaltechnik/spring2018/doku.php?id=schedule))

[4] This one is particullary strong when it comes to introducing methods of minimizing logical functions using various methods (Quine Mc-Cluskey, Petricks Method, ...)

## Programming Languages & Software Engineering

### VHDL & Verilog
1. Digital Design (Vahid, 2007)
2. VHDL for Digital Design (Vahid, 2007)
3. Verilog for Digital Design (Vahid, 2007)

### Compiler and Interpreter Construction^(1)
1. Crafting Interpreters (Nystrom, 2021)
2. Understanding and Writing Compilers (Bornat, 1979)

##### Notes to the list above
[1] If you are a complete freshman to this topic, i highly recommend to read [Ruslan Pivak's tutorial](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) on writing a simple Pascal interpreter in Python. Unfortunately, he stopped midway, but it gives you a headstart when reading the others from the list.

## Electronics

1. Principles of Electric Circuits (Buchla-Floyd, 2020)^(1)
2. Electronic Devices (Floyd, 2018)^(2)

##### Notes to the above list
[1] Always go with the version for conventional current flow
[2] This book can be seen as a continuation of [1] which after having good knowledge of electrical circuits, deep-dives into semiconductor devices
