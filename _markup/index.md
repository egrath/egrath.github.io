# Nothing to see here ...

... but feel free to take a look around. This is my personal webspace which acts as a space for various things I want to publish to a broader audience.

## How?

I'm by far not a designer. I like a simple approach for creating this webpage, something that once set up gets out of my way. This is why i chose the following tools and techniques:

* the content itself is stored as plain markup files with [John Gruber's](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax
* this content is transformed into html with [Discount](https://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/)
* during the transformation, CSS is merged in, which is responsible for the appearance

With this approach, whenever I want to create some new page, it boils down to writing something in markup, and rebuild everything (with make)

If you're interested in this, you can also take a look into the [github](https://github.com/egrath/egrath.github.io) repository for these pages.

## What to find here?

All content can be found [here](/pages/pages.html)

## A cat

No page is complete without the picture of a cat.
